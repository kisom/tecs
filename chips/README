customised chips - all chips built completely from NAND operations. these
do not use already-built chips.

naming convention: either the chip name or abbreviation in caps, ex.
    NAND, AND, OR. this is to separate it from the book's naming scheme.

test scripts: every chip needs to be verified via a test script.
